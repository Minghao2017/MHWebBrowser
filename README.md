## Feature

1. Webkit driven.
2. Indicating of loading status,progress, page title etc.
3. Javascript bridge supported.Javascript can call native sync or async methods in the same way.
4. Friendly API. Both of above are provided by delegate pattern.

## Concepts

### Async

![async](resources/svg/js_call_oc.svg)

The **async** here has two meanings:
1. The call progress itself is async.That includes the progress 1,2,3 in the diagram above.
2. The method executed in progress 2 can be either async or sync.

### Promise

![promise](https://javascript.info/article/promise-basics/promise-resolve-reject.png)

The calling process is completed by javascript promise. The whole process can be divided into two process.
1. The resolver and rejector is generated by js and stored in cache.
2. The native side(ObjectiveC) do its work and resolve or reject the promise.
